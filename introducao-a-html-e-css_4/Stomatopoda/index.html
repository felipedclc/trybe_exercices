                <h3>His a gentlemen</h3>
                <p>Most people have three types of light-detecting cells, or photoreceptors, which are sensitive to red,
                    green and blue light. But the mantis shrimp has anywhere from 12 to 16 different photoreceptors in
                    its midband. Most people assume that they must therefore be really good at seeing a wide range of
                    colours—a “thermonuclear bomb of light and beauty”, as the Oatmeal put it. But last year, Hanna
                    Thoen from the University of Queensland found that they’re much worse at discriminating between
                    coloursthey’re much worse at discriminating between coloursthey’re much worse at discriminating
                    between coloursthey’re much worse at discriminating between coloursthey’re much worse at
                    discriminating between colours than most other animals! They seem to use their dozen-plus receptors
                    to recognise colours in a unique way that’s very different to other animals but oddly similar to
                    some satellites.

                <h3>Undersea nightmare</h3>
                <p>Eyes are testaments to evolution’s creativity. They all do the same basic things—detect light, and
                    convert it into electrical signals—but in such a wondrous variety of ways. There are single and
                    compound eyes, bifocal lenses and rocky ones, mirrors and optic fibres. And there are eyes that are
                    so alien, so constantly surprising, that after decades of research, scientists have only just about
                    figured out how they work, let alone why they evolved that way. To find them, you need to go for a
                    swim.

                <h3>Fast and strong</h3>
                <p>Here’s an analogy: say you’ve got a big crowd lining up in front of six security guards, each of whom
                    must shout out when they spot someone with a specific name. One recognises Adams, another targets
                    Bobs, and so on. But the guards aren’t too bright; they wouldn’t know Adam if he introduced himself.
                    So you make their job easier. You rig the queuing system so that only Adams line up in front of
                    Adam-blocking guard, only Bobs reaching the Bob-blocker, and so on. The guards shout pretty much
                    indiscriminately, but they still do their jobs correctly. They’re not specific; you impose
                    specificity onto them.</p>
